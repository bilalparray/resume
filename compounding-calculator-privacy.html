      <p>Effective Date:10-08-2024</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to the Compounding Calculator App ("we", "our", "us"). This
        Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard
        your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). By
        using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in
        accordance with this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect any personal information from users of the App. The
        only information we may collect is related to the app’s usage, such as
        performance metrics and general device information. This data helps us
        understand how users interact with our app and improve its
        functionality.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Usage Data</h2>
      <p>
        Usage Data is collected automatically when using the App. This may
        include information such as your device’s Internet Protocol address
        (e.g., IP address), device type, operating system, app version, and
        usage statistics. This information is used solely for enhancing user
        experience and analyzing trends to improve the App.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Our App displays ads provided by third-party advertisers. These
        advertisers may collect information about your usage of the App and
        other apps to deliver relevant ads to you. This may include information
        such as your device’s IP address, browsing behavior, and interaction
        with ads.
      </p>

      <h3>3.1 Third-Party Ad Networks</h3>
      <p>
        We use third-party ad networks to serve ads within the App. These ad
        networks may use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies to
        collect information about your visits to the App and other websites to
        provide relevant ads and measure ad performance.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files placed on your device by websites you
        visit. We do not use cookies directly, but third-party advertisers may
        use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your
        browsing activities across different apps and websites.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your information from
        unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please be aware that
        no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We
        cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        The App may contain links to third-party websites or services that are
        not operated by us. We have no control over and assume no responsibility
        for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party
        websites or services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of
        any third-party sites you visit.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do
        not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we
        become aware that we have collected personal information from a child
        under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to
        delete that information.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you
        of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with an
        updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
        periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your
